#### Zebracorn Robotics Safety Outreach

We share our lab with 4 FLL teams and 2 FTC teams. We take this opportunity to share with them about safety!

 For 2 1/2 years (2016-2018) our lab was at Northgate Mall. We often had people stop by to ask about the robot. We always made sure to talk about safety and have them put on safety glasses while we showed them all about FIRST!
