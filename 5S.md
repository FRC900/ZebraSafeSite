#### Our Lab and Pit are 5S Zones!

![#eb202d](https://placehold.it/15/eb202d/000000?text=+) Sort - Organization is key in our pit and our lab.

We use our road cases in both our pits and the lab to increase muscle memory for tool location. Each drawer even has custom dividers!

We even sort our daily tasks with checklists for completion
