#### Be Proactive
We do our best to take a proactive aproach to safety! 
* Safety glasses are kept close at hand to supply both the team and visitors
* Hair ties are easily accessible for anyone with long hair

#### Fire Safety!
We take fire safety seriously. As part of that, we have invested in an Element Fire Extinquisher. [Element extinquishers](https://elementfire.com/) put out all major classes of fire and never expire.
