#### Be Proactive
We do our best to take a proactive aproach to safety! 
* Safety glasses are kept close at hand to supply both the team and visitors
* Hair ties are easily accessible for anyone with long hair
* We shout "Enabled" before enabling the robot and ensure everyone nearby knows to robot may move

#### Fire Safety!
We take fire safety seriously. As part of that, we have invested in an Element Fire Extinquisher. Element extinquishers put out all major classes of fire and never expire.
